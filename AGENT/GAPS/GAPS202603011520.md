**Post-Push Full Gap Audit — Phase 9**

**Verdict**
- Phase 9 implementation is complete at code level and passes full regression validation.
- No remaining implementation gaps were found in seeding logic, observability middleware, readiness endpoints, bridge timing instrumentation, docs/demo, or test coverage.
- One environment-dependent operational prerequisite remains for runtime seed benchmarking: local PostgreSQL must be running.

**Audit Coverage Matrix**
1. Seed pipeline completeness
- Status: **PASS**
- Evidence: `scripts/seed_db.py` implements hybrid topology, deterministic IDs, crop profiles, bulk inserts for all layer tables, and timing/count report.

2. Observability implementation
- Status: **PASS**
- Evidence: `app/middleware/logging.py` implements structured logging config, request-id propagation, per-request timing, failure logging; wired in `app/main.py`.

3. Health/readiness strategy
- Status: **PASS**
- Evidence: `app/main.py` keeps `/health` shallow and adds `/health/ready` deep checks (DB, Redis, Julia runtime).

4. Julia bridge call timing
- Status: **PASS**
- Evidence: `app/services/julia_bridge.py` now logs per-operation latency for all bridge calls.

5. Documentation + demo coverage
- Status: **PASS**
- Evidence: `README.md` now includes readiness and observability sections; `scripts/demo_queries.sh` expanded to major endpoint demos.

6. Test coverage additions
- Status: **PASS**
- Evidence: `tests/test_phase9_system.py` and `tests/test_seed_script.py` added and passing.

**Validation Evidence**
- Python full suite: `52 passed`
- Julia full suite: `561 passed`
- Phase-9 targeted tests: `6 passed`

**Gap Identified During Audit (Resolved Immediately)**
- Seed script CLI previously emitted raw traceback when DB was unavailable.
- Remediation applied in `scripts/seed_db.py`:
  - graceful failure report with actionable hint
  - single-loop cleanup path (`engine.dispose()` in async finally)
- Re-validation: targeted Phase-9 tests still passing.

**Operational Prerequisite (Not a code gap)**
- `python scripts/seed_db.py` currently exits with clear failure message due DB connection refusal (`localhost:5432` unavailable in current environment).
- This is expected outside provisioned runtime; performance timing (`<30s`) must be measured with Postgres/Redis running.

**Closure Status**
- Phase 9: **Closed (implementation-complete, audited, validated)**.
