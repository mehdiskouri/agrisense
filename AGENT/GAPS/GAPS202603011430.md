**Closure Verdict**
- Phase 9 implementation is complete with no open code-level gaps in scoped deliverables.

**Audit Scope**
- Seed script implementation completeness and data-model coverage
- Observability middleware + request-id propagation
- Health split endpoint behavior (`/health` + `/health/ready`)
- Julia bridge timing instrumentation
- Documentation/demo updates
- Regression safety across Python and Julia suites

**Resolved During Implementation**
- Implemented previously stubbed seed pipeline in `scripts/seed_db.py` with:
  - hybrid topology creation
  - deterministic UUID mapping
  - crop profile insertion
  - bulk insert paths for all synthetic layers
  - timing + row-count seed report
- Implemented structured request logging in `app/middleware/logging.py` and wired in `app/main.py`.
- Added deep readiness endpoint and internal checks in `app/main.py` while keeping `/health` shallow.
- Added timing instrumentation to all bridge operations in `app/services/julia_bridge.py`.
- Expanded docs and demo coverage in `README.md` and `scripts/demo_queries.sh`.
- Added Phase-9 tests: `tests/test_phase9_system.py`, `tests/test_seed_script.py`.

**Verification Evidence**
- Python full suite: `52 passed`
- Julia full suite: `562 passed`
- New Phase-9 tests: `6 passed`

**Operational Note**
- Runtime seed duration evidence (`<30s` target) depends on a warm local runtime + available Postgres/Redis. Script now emits direct timing metrics (`duration_ms`, per-layer timings) for objective measurement when run in a fully provisioned environment.

**Status**
- Phase 9 is code-complete and test-validated with no remaining implementation gaps from this audit.
